The project focuses on performing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations using Python. In this project, you will:

Extract data from different file types such as CSV, JSON, and XML.
Transform the extracted data into the required format, for example, rounding price values to two decimal places.
Load the transformed data into a target file (like a CSV) or database for further processing.
Implement logging to track the progress of these operations.
This hands-on project helps you practice reading various data formats, transforming data as per requirements, and preparing it for loading into an RDBMS or other storage.
